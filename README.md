This repository is a simple web page example which is created using HTML and CSS only.
Please do not get overwhelmed with so many files here.


- In folder CSS, 2 CSS files are present. These are important. Do not delete them or move them.
- 400.jpg is the hero element image downloaded from http://unsplash.com
- README.md is the file you are reading right now.
- index.html is the main HTML file which you need to open in a browser.
- teja2.jpg is the logo used in the webpage.
- template.jpg is the image visible below and also a good estimate of the end result.
